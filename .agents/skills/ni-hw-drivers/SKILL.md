# NI Python Instruments Skill

This skill helps generate correct, production-quality Python code for NI modular instrument drivers
(the `nimi-python` family of packages). It prevents common AI code generation mistakes by encoding
the actual API patterns, enum names, session lifecycle, and measurement workflows from the official
NI Python API documentation.

## Why this skill exists

LLMs frequently hallucinate NI API details: inventing method names, using wrong enum values, 
misunderstanding the session state machine, or producing code that would fail silently on real hardware.
This skill provides ground-truth patterns so generated code works on first run.

**When a user asks about a specific driver, read the corresponding reference file before generating code.**
If the driver's reference file doesn't exist yet, note this to the user and generate best-effort code
using the universal patterns below, which are shared across all nimi-python drivers.

## Universal Patterns (All nimi-python Drivers)

### Installation

All nimi-python driver packages follow the same naming convention and install via pip:

```
pip install nidcpower
pip install nidmm
pip install niscope
```

The NI driver runtime for the corresponding instrument must also be installed on the system
(available from ni.com/downloads). The Python package is a wrapper — it does not include the driver itself.

### Session Lifecycle

Every nimi-python driver uses the same session pattern. **Always use context managers** to ensure
proper resource cleanup, especially since instruments control real hardware with real voltages/currents.

```python
import nidcpower  # or nidmm, niscope, etc.

# CORRECT: Context manager ensures session closes even on error
with nidcpower.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot2/0") as session:
    # configure, source, measure...
    pass
# Session is automatically closed, output disabled safely

# WRONG: Never do this — leaked sessions lock the instrument
session = nidcpower.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot2/0")
# if an exception occurs here, the session is never closed
```

**Session constructor parameters** (common across drivers):
- `resource_name` (str, required): Instrument address, e.g. `"PXI1Slot2"`, `"PXI1Slot2/0"`, `"Dev1"`
- `channels` (str, optional): Channel selection, e.g. `"0"`, `"0,1"`, `"0-3"` (some drivers use resource_name for channel, e.g. `"PXI1Slot2/0"`)
- `reset` (bool, optional): If True, reset device to known state on open
- `options` (str, optional): Simulation and driver options, e.g. `"Simulate=1, DriverSetup=Model:4162; BoardType:PXIe"`

### Channel Indexing

Access specific channels using Python index notation on the session:

```python
# All channels (default when calling directly on session)
session.voltage_level = 5.0

# Specific channel(s)
session.channels["0"].voltage_level = 5.0
session.channels["0,1"].voltage_level = 5.0
session.channels[range(4)].measure_multiple()
```

### Programming State Machine

All NI instrument drivers follow a state machine:

```
Uncommitted → Committed → Running → Uncommitted (loop)
```

1. **Uncommitted**: Properties can be set freely. This is the state after `__init__()` or after modifying a property.
2. **Committed**: Call `session.commit()` to validate and apply settings. Required before reading computed properties like `measure_record_delta_time`.
3. **Running**: Call `session.initiate()` (use as context manager: `with session.initiate():`). The instrument is actively sourcing/measuring.

Modifying any property while in Committed or Running reverts to Uncommitted.

### Error Handling

```python
import nidcpower

try:
    with nidcpower.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot2/0") as session:
        session.voltage_level = 5.0
        with session.initiate():
            measurements = session.fetch_multiple(count=10)
except nidcpower.errors.DriverError as e:
    print(f"NI driver error: {e}")
except nidcpower.errors.UnsupportedConfigurationError as e:
    print(f"Unsupported configuration: {e}")
except nidcpower.errors.DriverNotInstalledError as e:
    print(f"Driver not installed: {e}")
```

### Simulation Mode

For development/testing without hardware, use simulation:

```python
options = "Simulate=1, DriverSetup=Model:4162; BoardType:PXIe"
with nidcpower.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot2/0", options=options) as session:
    # Code runs identically to real hardware but returns simulated values
    pass
```

## Test Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Source-and-Measure

The most common pattern: set a voltage/current, wait for settling, take a measurement.
Read the driver-specific reference file for the exact properties and enums.

### Pattern 2: Voltage/Current Sweep

Step through a range of values, measuring at each point. Use advanced sequences
for hardware-timed sweeps (more accurate) or Python loops for software-timed sweeps
(simpler, more flexible).

### Pattern 3: Multi-Channel Coordination

Configure multiple channels independently, initiate together, measure in parallel.
Use channel indexing to address subsets.

### Pattern 4: PMIC Validation Workflow

A semiconductor validation workflow for Power Management ICs typically involves:
1. Configure supply rails (voltage levels, current limits, sequencing)
2. Enable outputs in correct power-up sequence
3. Measure quiescent current (Iq) with high-resolution aperture
4. Sweep load conditions
5. Verify regulation under transient conditions
6. Power down in reverse sequence

### Pattern 5: Data Logging / Continuous Measurement

Use `fetch_multiple` in a loop with `fetch_backlog` to continuously acquire measurements
without gaps. The `measure_record_length` and `measure_record_length_is_finite` properties
control whether acquisition runs continuously or stops after N samples.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong enum values**: Always use the driver's enum classes (e.g., `nidcpower.OutputFunction.DC_VOLTAGE`), never raw strings or integers.
2. **Missing `initiate()`**: Measurements return stale or zero data if the session isn't in the Running state.
3. **Not using context managers**: Both for `Session()` and `initiate()`. Leaked sessions lock hardware.
4. **Ignoring compliance**: Always check `measurement.in_compliance` — if True, the output hit its limit and the measurement may be invalid.
5. **Wrong timeout**: `fetch_multiple` will raise a timeout error if the instrument hasn't completed sourcing. Calculate timeout from `source_delay + aperture_time`.
6. **Setting properties during Running state**: This silently reverts to Uncommitted. Reconfigure between `initiate()` calls, or use on-the-fly properties where supported.
7. **Using `measure()` when `fetch_multiple()` is needed**: `measure()` / `measure_multiple()` are for on-demand single-point reads. For sequenced or record-based acquisition, use `fetch_multiple()`.
8. **E-load current sign**: Dedicated electronic loads (e.g., PXIe-4051) sink by design — set `current_level` to a **positive** value. Only SMUs acting as loads use negative `current_level`. Check the nidcpower reference "Electronic Load / Sinking" section for device-specific sign conventions.
9. **Using `autorange` on e-loads or power supplies**: The generic `session.autorange` property is not supported on dedicated e-loads (PXIe-4051) or some power supplies (PXIe-4151). Always use specific autorange properties: `voltage_level_autorange`, `current_limit_autorange`, `voltage_limit_autorange`, `current_level_autorange`.
10. **Wrong autorange property for mode**: In `DC_VOLTAGE` mode, the voltage side is the source level and the current side is the limit — use `voltage_level_autorange` and `current_limit_autorange`. In `DC_CURRENT` mode (e-load), the current side is the source level and the voltage side is the limit — use `current_level_autorange` and `voltage_limit_autorange`. Mixing them up (e.g., `voltage_level_autorange` on a current source) causes errors.

## Integration with Test Frameworks

### pytest

```python
import pytest
import nidcpower

@pytest.fixture
def smu_session():
    """Fixture providing a configured SMU session."""
    options = "Simulate=1, DriverSetup=Model:4162; BoardType:PXIe"
    with nidcpower.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot2/0", options=options) as session:
        session.source_mode = nidcpower.SourceMode.SINGLE_POINT
        session.output_function = nidcpower.OutputFunction.DC_VOLTAGE
        session.measure_when = nidcpower.MeasureWhen.AUTOMATICALLY_AFTER_SOURCE_COMPLETE
        yield session

def test_voltage_regulation(smu_session):
    """Verify DUT output voltage is within spec."""
    smu_session.voltage_level = 3.3
    smu_session.current_limit = 0.5
    with smu_session.initiate():
        measurements = smu_session.fetch_multiple(count=10)
    voltages = [m.voltage for m in measurements]
    assert all(3.2 < v < 3.4 for v in voltages), f"Voltage out of spec: {voltages}"
```

### Robot Framework

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    NIDCPowerLibrary.py

*** Test Cases ***
Verify 3.3V Rail
    [Setup]    Open SMU Session    PXI1Slot2/0
    Configure DC Voltage    3.3    current_limit=0.5
    ${measurements}=    Measure Voltage    count=10
    Should Be Within Tolerance    ${measurements}    3.3    tolerance=0.1
    [Teardown]    Close SMU Session
```

## Adding a New Driver Reference

To add support for a new NI driver, create a reference file at `references/<driver_name>.md` with:

1. **Key enums and their values** (OutputFunction, MeasureWhen, SourceMode, etc.)
2. **Essential session properties** with types and valid ranges
3. **Core methods** with signatures and return types
4. **Canonical code examples** for the 3-5 most common workflows
5. **Driver-specific gotchas** that differ from the universal patterns above

Then update the Supported Drivers table in this file.
